# Sampling

We discuss an observation strategy for obtain a movie of M87*.

Scientifically, we are interested in the statistical properties of an M87* movie, instead of a specific movie realization.
In other word, we are interested in measuring the structure function of M87*.
For simplicity, we assume EHT is capable of obtaining an uniform resolution movie.
We focus on estimating the time structure function for each of the pixel in such movie.
